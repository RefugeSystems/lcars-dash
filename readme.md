This project is aimed at interfacing with an RS-LCARS Library to display sets of information.

# Testing

## Specifications

These are the unit tests for the system to ensure that each "part" is fulfilling its specifications. This is typically described directly in the YuiDocs for the piece being tested and the functions underneath it.

## Scenarios

These are essentially the use cases for the system and generally involve the system coming online with basic shims in place to remove the need for things like databases while the tests run to ensure the same data is being returned and to avoid false failures due problems not within the code, such as connectivity problems.
